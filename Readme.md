## WinMM
CGO bindings for the core winmm.lib Api to record and play audio on Windows.
This package does not include all of the API calls but is capable of recording and playing audio in an easy way.

⚠ *Side project, be careful when using it. Tested only in x64 Golang compiler*

### Usage
You can find a ready to run example of how to use the package in the example folder. If you need more help on a certain function you can refer to: https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/

I do not include documentation of how to use it since it's all already documented in the official webpage.
